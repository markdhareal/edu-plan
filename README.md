# 👨‍🏫 EduPlan
EduPlan is a user-friendly tool designed to make lesson planning faster. With the power of AI, it generates lesson plans in seconds, so teachers can focus more on teaching and less on preparation. Once your plan is generated, you can tweak it to your liking in Microsoft Word.

# 🌱 For New LPTs & Educators
With many new LPTs (Licensure Professional Teachers) entering the field, I truly hope EduPlan can be a helpful tool for both aspiring and professional teachers, making lesson planning faster and easier, so they can focus on shaping young minds.

# ⚙️ Early Stage Reminder:
The app is still in its early stages, so you may encounter some bugs. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated as I continue to improve it.
